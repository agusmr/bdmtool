a simple tool to analyze stock price movement in IDX ( Indonesia Stock Exchange ) using bandarmology method

History - EN
=======

Back in 2017, i attend a Bandarmology seminar which basically teach us, local Indonesian retail stock trader & investor
, to analyze & decide whether to buy / sell based on the movement big player & retailer.

They also provide a ms excel based - macro tool which can be used to analyze the broker data summary, provided by HOTS & IPOT online trading platform.

However, since i found it to be less intuitive ( personal preference obviously ), and i kinda have an interest on how it works.
So, i decide to do some tinkering around it, and build something useful

I build this in 2017, and i haven't release it since then, made some profit, then i decide to share it. Who knows it might be useful for you.

Jadi, pada tahun 2017 kemarin, saya ikut seminar bandarmologi, yang lama berkutat di pasar saham pasti pernah denger lah.
Berhubung saya juga seorang programmer, maka saya memutuskan untuk bikin tool sendiri yg algoritmanya kurang lebih mirip dengan
yang ada pada tool yg dikasih oleh EO seminar tsb
